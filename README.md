# ùïåpdec

ùïåpdec is a Python library for mesh-free PDE simulation and control. __ùïåpdec__ stands for Universal(__ùïå__) Partial Differential Equations (__PDE__) Controller(__C__).

There is no faster way to test your PDE than to use Updec !

It workes well for:
- 2D PDEs
- Linear
- Scalar
- Non evolving bcs

## Features
ùïåpdec is equipped with the following features:
- Lightning fast mesh-free simulation via Radial Basis Functions
- Automatic handling of all boundary conditions
- Robust differentiable simulation via JAX
- Automatic generation of normals from 2D GMSH meshes
- Performance portability to CPU, GPU, and TPU
Features will be added on-demand (see list of To-Dos below)


## Getting started
The package is available on PyPi. You can install it via:
```
pip install Updec
```
Check out the example notebooks and scripts in the folder [`demos`](./demos)!


## To-Dos
- Integrate Updec into an ODE solver: y_ = y + dt * Updec(y, t)
- Iterative solver
- Make pde_solve_multidims that takes in the various differential operators, and finds the stable point!
- Do the same for non-linear PDEs
- Fix the adjoint with Alex
- Contribute to Diffrax

### More To-Dos
- Review the [specifications for JOSS](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html)
- Setup automated tests via GitHub actions CI/CD
- Add comments and generate Documentation (like [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/))
- Code more demos and animations of PDEs: 
    - [advection-diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation) and other cool linear equations 
    - the Navier-Stokes in a channel with a step 
    - etc.
- Publish to social media (and to my website)
- Research dynamic point clouds for time-dependent problems
- Parallelise time-dependent problems in time
- Add support for USD files


## Dependencies
- JAX
- GMSH
- PyVista
- FFMPEG
